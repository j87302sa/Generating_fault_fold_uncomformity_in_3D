This coding is for generating a geological model that combines features such as fold, fault and uncomformity. The aim is to create a model that resemblances the real world subsurface structures. 

Note that appropriate libraries need to be installed before running the cells. The installation guide can be found at the gempy.org website. 

The comments are written alongside the code for explaination.
